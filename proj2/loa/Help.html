<h1> Lines of Action </h1>

<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
A piece may move horizontally, vertically, diagonally subject to the following constraints:
1) A piece may only move a distance equal to the number of pieces (friendly and opposing) which lie along its "Line of Action"
2) A piece MAY hop friendly pieces, but not opposing pieces
3) If a piece lands on an opposing piece, it is "captured" and removed from the board
4) A player wins if all his pieces are contiguous: they all touch in some fashion.

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
This GUI uses drag and drop: you must click and drag a desired piece to its desired location. If valid, it will perform the move.
If the move is not valid, the piece will not be moved.  You have access to the following commands under the game tab:
1) New: starts a new game
2) Help: displays this help page
3) Undo: retracts 2 moves
4) Quit: quit the current game
5) Switch: this button changes the current player, if manual, to an AI.
